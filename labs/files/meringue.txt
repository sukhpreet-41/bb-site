Meringue

Ingredients:

    4 egg whites
    1 cup granulated sugar
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    Pinch of salt

Instructions:

    Preheat oven to 225°F (105°C).
    In a clean, dry bowl, whip egg whites until foamy.
    Gradually add sugar, then vanilla and salt, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form.
    Spoon meringue onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, forming small mounds.
    Bake for 1-1.5 hours, or until meringues are dry and crisp.
    Turn off oven and leave meringues inside to cool completely.
