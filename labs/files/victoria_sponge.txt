Victoria Sponge

Ingredients:

    1 cup unsalted butter, softened
    1 cup granulated sugar
    4 eggs
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    1/4 cup milk
    Strawberry jam and whipped cream, for filling

Instructions:

    Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.
    Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
    Sift in flour and baking powder, then fold into the batter.
    Add milk and mix until smooth.
    Divide the mixture between two greased and lined cake tins.
    Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and a toothpick comes out clean.
    Cool on a wire rack. Once cooled, spread jam on one sponge, top with whipped cream, and sandwich with the second sponge.
